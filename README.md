Q1:Define blockchain in your own words (100â€“150 words).  
Blockchain is a chain of blocks in which each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one. It is a decentralised digital ledger that operates on a secure peer-to-peer network, thereby preventing central control. Each block contains information like transaction records(data), timestamp marks, unique hash identifier(merkle root), previous hash information and nonce. The chain acts like a linked list, which is immutable. As each block depends on the hash of the previous block, tampering with the information in any of the blocks breaks the chain, making the system very secure. All the data is stored across many computers/nodes in a network, providing the same copy to everyone. This structure ensures transparency, security and trust so no single person can change the data without others knowing.
