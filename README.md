PART1: Blockchain Basics  


Q1:Define blockchain in your own words (100–150 words).  

Blockchain is a chain of blocks in which each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one. It is a decentralised digital ledger that operates on a secure peer-to-peer network, thereby preventing central control. Each block contains information like transaction records(data), timestamp marks, unique hash identifier(merkle root), previous hash information and nonce. The chain acts like a linked list, which is immutable. As each block depends on the hash of the previous block, tampering with the information in any of the blocks breaks the chain, making the system very secure. All the data is stored across many computers/nodes in a network, providing the same copy to everyone. This structure ensures transparency, security and trust so no single person can change the data without others knowing.


Q2: List 2 real-life use cases (e.g., supply chain, digital identity).  

2 real-life use case of Blockchain are:-
1. Walmart – Food Supply Chain Tracking
Walmart, in partnership with IBM’s Food Trust, uses blockchain to track the origin and journey of food products like mangoes and pork. Earlier, it used to take days to trace contaminated food, but with the help of blockchain, it takes just seconds to trace where a product came from, improving food safety and transparency.
2. Estonia – Digital Identity for Citizens
Estonia uses blockchain to manage its citizens' digital identities and public services. Through this, citizens can access healthcare, vote online, and manage bank accounts securely. Blockchain ensures data integrity, privacy, and tamper-proof records in government services.
